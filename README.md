# Project Sanhab
 
Welcome to project $anhab 

Project Sanhab is a game created by Shahab Shahrashoob and Sania Dolat Abadi which is similar to a game known as Battleship (aka Sea Battle) .

The game starts with a menu where you can choose to play singleplayer , multiplayer or watch your last game which has been recorded by game's code .
 
Singleplayer game contains playing with an AI that will randomly attack your side until it finds a ship square . then it will attack its sides untill all four sides are checked (Ai will remember where has been hit the previous round) .

In every game at the beginning , every player has a number of ships which can be customized in size and number . Then they have a number of repairs that can be used every round but will use player's fuel . So you can't attack while repairing your ship .

The battle begins with player 1 (Human in singleplayer) . Player 2's board is now visible to player 1 with its ships hidden . Player 1 can attack by entering his coordinates and then the result of the attack will be shown with a green 'O' as a miss and a red 'â˜¼' . after that it's Player 2's turn to play . As for the repairs , Player should enter R to go to repair mode which Player can see their own side with its damaged ships . After rapairing the ship , the result of the repair will be shown to the player and his/her turn ends .

Game continues until one of the Players has no more ship to play with or they want to exit . Players should enter E to exit the game . Their game is now saved in game folder and they can play again by going to menu and choosing multiplayer and then Continue the last game option . Remember that game saves ONLY and ONLY when players exit the game by E . If you close the program the game won't save . 


As Shahab Shahrashoob I enjoyed the progress of the code more than its results . It was my greatest pleasure to code with Miss Dolat Abadi .

Hope you enjoy the game .
